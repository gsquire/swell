A web server in Rust.

This is my senior project at Cal Poly. It will be under constant construction
until June when I graduate. I will do my best to keep up with the Rust releases. I am no expert and this is a huge learning experience for me and should not be used in production in any form.

The name is inspired from my love of the ocean and surfing.

**Currently, I build the project using 1.0.0-alpha.2. Once beta is released and the old_io package is changed, I will migrate my code to use the newer libraries. But for now, I can achieve a more stable build using the second alpha release.**
